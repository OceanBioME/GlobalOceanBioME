This repository contains code for modelling global ocean biogeochemistry with [OceanBioME](https://github.com/oceanBioME/oceanBioME.jl) and [Oceananigans](https://github.com/cliMA/oceananigans.jl/).

Currently, it contains a script for a repeat year forcing near global 1 degree model using [ClimaOcean](https://github.com/cliMA/ClimaOcean.jl) as a base. **Please note**  this script was written as a demonstration and the physics and biogeochemistry are uncallibrated.

We very much welcome contributors and please contact us if you are interested in collaborating on this project.
